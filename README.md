00:00:04.264 --> 00:00:06.120
When I was first learning to meditate,

00:00:06.144 --> 00:00:09.200
the instruction was to simply
pay attention to my breath,

00:00:09.224 --> 00:00:11.304
and when my mind wandered,
to bring it back.

00:00:12.144 --> 00:00:13.504
Sounded simple enough.

00:00:14.184 --> 00:00:17.400
Yet I'd sit on these silent retreats,

00:00:17.424 --> 00:00:20.760
sweating through T-shirts
in the middle of winter.

00:00:20.784 --> 00:00:24.120
I'd take naps every chance I got
because it was really hard work.

00:00:24.144 --> 00:00:26.144
Actually, it was exhausting.

00:00:26.904 --> 00:00:28.640
The instruction was simple enough

00:00:28.664 --> 00:00:30.784
but I was missing something
really important.

00:00:31.824 --> 00:00:34.064
So why is it so hard to pay attention?

00:00:34.584 --> 00:00:36.040
Well, studies show

00:00:36.064 --> 00:00:39.240
that even when we're really
trying to pay attention to something --

00:00:39.264 --> 00:00:40.840
like maybe this talk --

00:00:40.864 --> 00:00:42.080
at some point,

00:00:42.104 --> 00:00:44.440
about half of us
will drift off into a daydream,

00:00:44.464 --> 00:00:46.544
or have this urge
to check our Twitter feed.

00:00:47.864 --> 00:00:49.384
So what's going on here?

00:00:50.504 --> 00:00:53.960
It turns out that we're fighting one
of the most evolutionarily-conserved

00:00:53.984 --> 00:00:56.840
learning processes
currently known in science,

00:00:56.864 --> 00:00:58.080
one that's conserved

00:00:58.104 --> 00:01:00.544
back to the most basic
nervous systems known to man.

00:01:01.344 --> 00:01:03.000
This reward-based learning process

00:01:03.024 --> 00:01:05.200
is called positive
and negative reinforcement,

00:01:05.224 --> 00:01:06.784
and basically goes like this.

00:01:07.704 --> 00:01:09.400
We see some food that looks good,

00:01:09.424 --> 00:01:12.120
our brain says, "Calories! ... Survival!"

00:01:12.144 --> 00:01:13.640
We eat the food, we taste it --

00:01:13.664 --> 00:01:14.880
it tastes good.

00:01:14.904 --> 00:01:16.440
And especially with sugar,

00:01:16.464 --> 00:01:18.720
our bodies send a signal
to our brain that says,

00:01:18.744 --> 00:01:21.224
"Remember what you're eating
and where you found it."

00:01:22.784 --> 00:01:25.520
We lay down this context-dependent memory

00:01:25.544 --> 00:01:28.000
and learn to repeat the process next time.

00:01:28.024 --> 00:01:29.240
See food,

00:01:29.264 --> 00:01:30.960
eat food, feel good,

00:01:30.984 --> 00:01:32.440
repeat.

00:01:32.464 --> 00:01:35.080
Trigger, behavior, reward.

00:01:35.104 --> 00:01:36.304
Simple, right?

00:01:37.424 --> 00:01:39.560
Well, after a while,
our creative brains say,

00:01:39.584 --> 00:01:40.800
"You know what?

00:01:40.824 --> 00:01:44.440
You can use this for more
than just remembering where food is.

00:01:44.464 --> 00:01:46.640
You know, next time you feel bad,

00:01:46.664 --> 00:01:50.104
why don't you try eating
something good so you'll feel better?"

00:01:51.224 --> 00:01:53.240
We thank our brains for the great idea,

00:01:53.264 --> 00:01:54.840
try this and quickly learn

00:01:54.864 --> 00:01:58.160
that if we eat chocolate or ice cream
when we're mad or sad,

00:01:58.184 --> 00:01:59.384
we feel better.

00:02:00.144 --> 00:02:01.520
Same process,

00:02:01.544 --> 00:02:03.280
just a different trigger.

00:02:03.304 --> 00:02:06.400
Instead of this hunger signal
coming from our stomach,

00:02:06.424 --> 00:02:08.400
this emotional signal -- feeling sad --

00:02:08.424 --> 00:02:09.704
triggers that urge to eat.

00:02:10.544 --> 00:02:12.064
Maybe in our teenage years,

00:02:12.703 --> 00:02:14.104
we were a nerd at school,

00:02:15.104 --> 00:02:17.800
and we see those rebel kids
outside smoking and we think,

00:02:17.824 --> 00:02:19.080
"Hey, I want to be cool."

00:02:19.104 --> 00:02:20.304
So we start smoking.

00:02:21.304 --> 00:02:25.040
The Marlboro Man wasn't a dork,
and that was no accident.

00:02:25.064 --> 00:02:26.280
See cool,

00:02:26.304 --> 00:02:27.600
smoke to be cool,

00:02:27.624 --> 00:02:29.440
feel good. Repeat.

00:02:29.464 --> 00:02:31.464
Trigger, behavior, reward.

00:02:32.144 --> 00:02:33.400
And each time we do this,

00:02:33.424 --> 00:02:35.440
we learn to repeat the process

00:02:35.464 --> 00:02:36.704
and it becomes a habit.

00:02:37.424 --> 00:02:38.720
So later,

00:02:38.744 --> 00:02:42.360
feeling stressed out triggers
that urge to smoke a cigarette

00:02:42.384 --> 00:02:43.784
or to eat something sweet.

00:02:44.704 --> 00:02:47.640
Now, with these same brain processes,

00:02:47.664 --> 00:02:49.560
we've gone from learning to survive

00:02:49.584 --> 00:02:52.440
to literally killing ourselves
with these habits.

00:02:52.464 --> 00:02:53.720
Obesity and smoking

00:02:53.744 --> 00:02:58.024
are among the leading preventable causes
of morbidity and mortality in the world.

00:02:58.984 --> 00:03:00.384
So back to my breath.

00:03:01.224 --> 00:03:03.600
What if instead of fighting our brains,

00:03:03.624 --> 00:03:06.160
or trying to force ourselves
to pay attention,

00:03:06.184 --> 00:03:10.200
we instead tapped into this natural,
reward-based learning process ...

00:03:10.224 --> 00:03:11.424
but added a twist?

00:03:12.024 --> 00:03:14.080
What if instead we just got really curious

00:03:14.104 --> 00:03:16.600
about what was happening
in our momentary experience?

00:03:16.624 --> 00:03:18.160
I'll give you an example.

00:03:18.184 --> 00:03:19.400
In my lab,

00:03:19.424 --> 00:03:22.760
we studied whether mindfulness training
could help people quit smoking.

00:03:22.784 --> 00:03:26.440
Now, just like trying to force myself
to pay attention to my breath,

00:03:26.464 --> 00:03:29.720
they could try to force
themselves to quit smoking.

00:03:29.744 --> 00:03:32.680
And the majority of them
had tried this before and failed --

00:03:32.704 --> 00:03:34.624
on average, six times.

00:03:35.464 --> 00:03:36.960
Now, with mindfulness training,

00:03:36.984 --> 00:03:40.304
we dropped the bit about forcing
and instead focused on being curious.

00:03:41.104 --> 00:03:44.320
In fact, we even told them to smoke.

00:03:44.344 --> 00:03:46.320
What? Yeah, we said, "Go ahead and smoke,

00:03:46.344 --> 00:03:49.880
just be really curious
about what it's like when you do."

00:03:49.904 --> 00:03:51.600
And what did they notice?

00:03:51.624 --> 00:03:54.320
Well here's an example
from one of our smokers.

00:03:54.344 --> 00:03:56.080
She said, "Mindful smoking:

00:03:56.104 --> 00:03:57.720
smells like stinky cheese

00:03:57.744 --> 00:03:59.360
and tastes like chemicals,

00:03:59.384 --> 00:04:00.584
YUCK!"

00:04:01.184 --> 00:04:04.560
Now, she knew, cognitively
that smoking was bad for her,

00:04:04.584 --> 00:04:06.464
that's why she joined our program.

00:04:07.184 --> 00:04:11.720
What she discovered just by being
curiously aware when she smoked

00:04:11.744 --> 00:04:14.880
was that smoking tastes like shit.

00:04:14.904 --> 00:04:16.584
(Laughter)

00:04:17.864 --> 00:04:21.879
Now, she moved from knowledge to wisdom.

00:04:21.903 --> 00:04:24.999
She moved from knowing in her head
that smoking was bad for her

00:04:25.023 --> 00:04:27.480
to knowing it in her bones,

00:04:27.504 --> 00:04:29.800
and the spell of smoking was broken.

00:04:29.824 --> 00:04:33.184
She started to become
disenchanted with her behavior.

00:04:34.464 --> 00:04:36.560
Now, the prefrontal cortex,

00:04:36.584 --> 00:04:40.120
that youngest part of our brain
from an evolutionary perspective,

00:04:40.144 --> 00:04:44.200
it understands on an intellectual level
that we shouldn't smoke.

00:04:44.224 --> 00:04:48.040
And it tries its hardest
to help us change our behavior,

00:04:48.064 --> 00:04:49.400
to help us stop smoking,

00:04:49.424 --> 00:04:53.544
to help us stop eating that second,
that third, that fourth cookie.

00:04:54.464 --> 00:04:55.960
We call this cognitive control.

00:04:55.984 --> 00:04:58.784
We're using cognition
to control our behavior.

00:04:59.464 --> 00:05:00.680
Unfortunately,

00:05:00.704 --> 00:05:02.640
this is also the first part of our brain

00:05:02.664 --> 00:05:04.680
that goes offline
when we get stressed out,

00:05:04.704 --> 00:05:05.960
which isn't that helpful.

00:05:05.984 --> 00:05:08.461
Now, we can all relate to this
in our own experience.

00:05:08.485 --> 00:05:11.640
We're much more likely to do things
like yell at our spouse or kids

00:05:11.664 --> 00:05:13.280
when we're stressed out or tired,

00:05:13.304 --> 00:05:15.640
even though we know
it's not going to be helpful.

00:05:15.664 --> 00:05:17.184
We just can't help ourselves.

00:05:18.624 --> 00:05:20.800
When the prefrontal cortex goes offline,

00:05:20.824 --> 00:05:23.040
we fall back into our old habits,

00:05:23.064 --> 00:05:25.920
which is why this disenchantment
is so important.

00:05:25.944 --> 00:05:27.600
Seeing what we get from our habits

00:05:27.624 --> 00:05:29.800
helps us understand them
at a deeper level --

00:05:29.824 --> 00:05:31.080
to know it in our bones

00:05:31.104 --> 00:05:33.360
so we don't have to force
ourselves to hold back

00:05:33.384 --> 00:05:35.120
or restrain ourselves from behavior.

00:05:35.144 --> 00:05:37.920
We're just less interested
in doing it in the first place.

00:05:37.944 --> 00:05:40.480
And this is what mindfulness is all about:

00:05:40.504 --> 00:05:44.184
Seeing really clearly what we get
when we get caught up in our behaviors,

00:05:45.064 --> 00:05:48.640
becoming disenchanted on a visceral level

00:05:48.664 --> 00:05:51.784
and from this disenchanted stance,
naturally letting go.

00:05:52.424 --> 00:05:55.920
This isn't to say that, poof,
magically we quit smoking.

00:05:55.944 --> 00:05:58.560
But over time, as we learn
to see more and more clearly

00:05:58.584 --> 00:05:59.920
the results of our actions,

00:05:59.944 --> 00:06:02.584
we let go of old habits and form new ones.

00:06:03.624 --> 00:06:04.960
The paradox here

00:06:04.984 --> 00:06:07.800
is that mindfulness is just
about being really interested

00:06:07.824 --> 00:06:09.240
in getting close and personal

00:06:09.264 --> 00:06:11.840
with what's actually happening
in our bodies and minds

00:06:11.864 --> 00:06:13.480
from moment to moment.

00:06:13.504 --> 00:06:15.800
This willingness
to turn toward our experience

00:06:15.824 --> 00:06:19.504
rather than trying to make unpleasant
cravings go away as quickly as possible.

00:06:20.264 --> 00:06:22.840
And this willingness
to turn toward our experience

00:06:22.864 --> 00:06:24.720
is supported by curiosity,

00:06:24.744 --> 00:06:26.480
which is naturally rewarding.

00:06:26.504 --> 00:06:28.240
What does curiosity feel like?

00:06:28.264 --> 00:06:29.464
It feels good.

00:06:30.544 --> 00:06:32.850
And what happens when we get curious?

00:06:32.874 --> 00:06:36.320
We start to notice that cravings
are simply made up of body sensations --

00:06:36.344 --> 00:06:38.600
oh, there's tightness, there's tension,

00:06:38.624 --> 00:06:40.280
there's restlessness --

00:06:40.304 --> 00:06:42.744
and that these body
sensations come and go.

00:06:43.384 --> 00:06:46.360
These are bite-size pieces of experiences

00:06:46.384 --> 00:06:48.400
that we can manage from moment to moment

00:06:48.424 --> 00:06:52.560
rather than getting clobbered
by this huge, scary craving

00:06:52.584 --> 00:06:53.960
that we choke on.

00:06:53.984 --> 00:06:56.480
In other words, when we get curious,

00:06:56.504 --> 00:07:01.240
we step out of our old,
fear-based, reactive habit patterns,

00:07:01.264 --> 00:07:03.480
and we step into being.

00:07:03.504 --> 00:07:06.400
We become this inner scientist

00:07:06.424 --> 00:07:09.640
where we're eagerly awaiting
that next data point.

00:07:09.664 --> 00:07:14.200
Now, this might sound
too simplistic to affect behavior.

00:07:14.224 --> 00:07:16.680
But in one study,
we found that mindfulness training

00:07:16.704 --> 00:07:20.600
was twice as good as gold standard therapy
at helping people quit smoking.

00:07:20.624 --> 00:07:22.064
So it actually works.

00:07:23.304 --> 00:07:26.120
And when we studied
the brains of experienced meditators,

00:07:26.144 --> 00:07:29.960
we found that parts of a neural network
of self-referential processing

00:07:29.984 --> 00:07:31.560
called the default mode network

00:07:31.584 --> 00:07:32.800
were at play.

00:07:32.824 --> 00:07:35.760
Now, one current hypothesis
is that a region of this network,

00:07:35.784 --> 00:07:38.000
called the posterior cingulate cortex,

00:07:38.024 --> 00:07:40.760
is activated not necessarily
by craving itself

00:07:40.784 --> 00:07:43.400
but when we get caught up in it,
when we get sucked in,

00:07:43.424 --> 00:07:45.120
and it takes us for a ride.

00:07:45.144 --> 00:07:47.240
In contrast, when we let go --

00:07:47.264 --> 00:07:48.640
step out of the process

00:07:48.664 --> 00:07:51.160
just by being curiously aware
of what's happening --

00:07:51.184 --> 00:07:53.304
this same brain region quiets down.

00:07:54.824 --> 00:07:58.920
Now we're testing app and online-based
mindfulness training programs

00:07:58.944 --> 00:08:02.080
that target these core mechanisms

00:08:02.104 --> 00:08:06.600
and, ironically, use the same technology
that's driving us to distraction

00:08:06.624 --> 00:08:09.160
to help us step out
of our unhealthy habit patterns

00:08:09.184 --> 00:08:13.200
of smoking, of stress eating
and other addictive behaviors.

00:08:13.224 --> 00:08:15.800
Now, remember that bit
about context-dependent memory?

00:08:15.824 --> 00:08:18.720
We can deliver these tools
to peoples' fingertips

00:08:18.744 --> 00:08:21.000
in the contexts that matter most.

00:08:21.024 --> 00:08:22.240
So we can help them

00:08:22.264 --> 00:08:25.240
tap into their inherent capacity
to be curiously aware

00:08:25.264 --> 00:08:29.184
right when that urge to smoke
or stress eat or whatever arises.

00:08:30.144 --> 00:08:31.960
So if you don't smoke or stress eat,

00:08:31.984 --> 00:08:35.639
maybe the next time you feel this urge
to check your email when you're bored,

00:08:35.663 --> 00:08:37.903
or you're trying to distract
yourself from work,

00:08:37.927 --> 00:08:41.726
or maybe to compulsively respond
to that text message when you're driving,

00:08:42.584 --> 00:08:46.440
see if you can tap into
this natural capacity,

00:08:46.464 --> 00:08:47.720
just be curiously aware

00:08:47.744 --> 00:08:50.680
of what's happening in your body
and mind in that moment.

00:08:50.704 --> 00:08:52.160
It will just be another chance

00:08:52.184 --> 00:08:55.840
to perpetuate one of our endless
and exhaustive habit loops ...

00:08:55.864 --> 00:08:57.104
or step out of it.

00:08:57.584 --> 00:09:00.480
Instead of see text message,
compulsively text back,

00:09:00.504 --> 00:09:02.240
feel a little bit better --

00:09:02.264 --> 00:09:03.720
notice the urge,

00:09:03.744 --> 00:09:05.200
get curious,

00:09:05.224 --> 00:09:07.160
feel the joy of letting go

00:09:07.184 --> 00:09:08.384
and repeat.

00:09:08.944 --> 00:09:10.160
Thank you.

00:09:10.184 --> 00:09:12.544
(Applause)
